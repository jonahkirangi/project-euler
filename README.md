# Project Euler

JavaScript solutions to the Project Euler problems.

These problems/solutions are intended to strengthen my JavaScript skills. While
there is always more than one way to solve each problem, my goal is to ensure that all of my solutions are as concise as possible. If you see a way to [DRY](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself) up my code, please submit a pull request or send me a message. Thanks!

## Running the Code
